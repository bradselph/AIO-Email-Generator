### AIO-Email-Generator User Guide

#### Overview
AIO-Email-Generator is a command-line tool written in Go (Golang) that generates random email addresses for a specified email service provider and saves them to a file. The email addresses generated by this tool are completely fake and cannot be used to receive actual emails.

#### Installation
1. **Windows:** Download the prebuilt binary from the AIO-Email-Generator repository.
2. **Other Operating Systems:** If you want to build from source, you need to have Go installed on your system. If you haven't installed Go yet, you can download it from the [official Go website](https://golang.org/) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system. Refer to the [Building from Source Guide](#aio-email-generator-building-from-source-guide) for detailed instructions.

#### Usage
1. **Windows:** Double-click the executable file to run the program.
2. **Other Operating Systems:** Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the executable file is located.
4. To generate random email addresses, you can run the program in two ways:
   - **Interactive Mode:** Run the program without any arguments. You will be prompted to enter the email service provider and the number of email addresses to generate.
     ```sh
     ./main
     ```
   - **Command-line Mode:** Specify the email service provider and the number of email addresses directly in the command line.
     ```sh
     ./main <provider> <num_emails>
     ```
     Replace `<provider>` with the desired email service provider (e.g., `gmail`, `yahoo`) and `<num_emails>` with the number of email addresses to generate.
