### AIO-Email-Generator User Guide

#### Overview
AIO-Email-Generator is a command-line tool written in Go (Golang) that generates random email addresses for a specified email service provider and saves them to a file. The email addresses generated by this tool are completely fake and cannot be used to receive actual emails.

#### Prerequisites
Before using AIO-Email-Generator, you need to have Go installed on your system. If you haven't installed Go yet, you can download it from the [official Go website](https://golang.org/) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

#### Installation
1. Download the `main.go` file from the AIO-Email-Generator repository.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where you downloaded `main.go`.
4. Run the following command to compile the program:
   ```sh
   go build main.go
   ```
5. The executable file will be created in the same directory.

#### Usage
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the executable file is located.
3. To generate random email addresses, you can run the program in two ways:
    - **Interactive Mode:** Run the program without any arguments. You will be prompted to enter the email service provider and the number of email addresses to generate.
      ```sh
      ./main
      ```
    - **Command-line Mode:** Specify the email service provider and the number of email addresses directly in the command line.
      ```sh
      ./main <provider> <num_emails>
      ```
      Replace `<provider>` with the desired email service provider (e.g., `gmail`, `yahoo`) and `<num_emails>` with the number of email addresses to generate.

- The email addresses generated by this tool are completely fake and cannot be used to receive actual emails.
